# AI Counsel - Session Handover

**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Branch**: `feature/add-github-badges`
**Status**: Testing and logging improvements complete. Ready for next session.

## Summary of Work Completed

### 1. Badge Implementation ‚úÖ
- Added GitHub badges (stars, forks, last commit) to README
- Restructured README badges to match claude-telegram-bridge layout
- Added deliberation instructions to prompts to prevent model redirection

**PRs Merged**: #2-8

### 2. Backend Installation ‚úÖ
- Installed `sentence-transformers` (neural semantic similarity)
- Installed `scikit-learn` (TF-IDF backend)
- MCP server now uses SentenceTransformerBackend by default

### 3. Comprehensive Testing ‚úÖ
Three major test scenarios completed:

**Test 1**: Multi-Round Deliberation (Comments vs Self-Documenting Code)
- Vote grouping: WORKED (2 options ‚Üí 1 group merged)
- Consensus: True ‚úì

**Test 2**: 3-Model Deliberation (Remote Work)
- 3 models (Claude, Codex, Gemini)
- Vote grouping: Kept separate (correct - genuinely different positions)
- Consensus: True (majority_decision) ‚úì

**Test 3**: Multi-Round with Conference Mode (AI Existential Risk)
- **2 ROUNDS EXECUTED** - First true multi-round test! ‚úÖ
- convergence_info.detected: TRUE
- convergence_info.final_similarity: 0.7948-0.8246
- convergence_info.per_participant_similarity: POPULATED ‚úì
- Model refinement observed: Claude changed vote between rounds

### 4. Logging Improvements ‚úÖ
Changed vote grouping logging from DEBUG ‚Üí INFO level:
- Vote similarity calculations now visible
- Shows each comparison score vs 0.70 threshold
- Indicates when votes are grouped with checkmark (‚úì)

**Commit**: fa9deeb - "Elevate vote similarity logging from DEBUG to INFO level"

---

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ System is Working Correctly
- Convergence detection: Only runs Round 2+ (by design)
- Vote grouping: Working with SentenceTransformers backend
- Multi-round debate: Functional with model refinement across rounds
- Vote semantic grouping: Correctly merges options with ‚â•0.70 similarity

### Why Some Tests Showed "Empty" convergence_info
Tests 1-2 only executed 1 round. Convergence detection only runs Round 2+ (needs 2 rounds to compare). Test 3 with conference mode ran 2 rounds ‚Üí convergence_info fully populated.

---

## Outstanding Issues

### üî¥ MCP Server Connection Issue
After latest restart, server not responding (shows "Not connected").
**Solution**: Restart Claude Code session (this handover is happening because of this).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor: scores_by_round Always Empty
- convergence_info.scores_by_round: `[]` (always empty)
- System only tracks final similarity, not per-round progression
- Not blocking, but could be improved

## Next Steps for New Session

1. **Restart MCP Connection**
   - Start new Claude Code session
   - Should automatically reconnect

2. **Test the Improved Logging**
   - Run deliberation with conference mode and 2+ rounds
   - Check logs for new INFO-level vote similarity scores

3. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Implement scores_by_round tracking
   - Document early stopping behavior
   - Consider dashboard or transcript viewer

4. **Marketing Materials Ready**
   - 3 debate transcripts generated
   - Blog post template created
   - HackerNews post template created
   - Twitter thread template created

---

## Production Readiness

- ‚úÖ All tests passing (108+ unit/integration/e2e)
- ‚úÖ Type-safe with Pydantic validation
- ‚úÖ Graceful error handling throughout
- ‚úÖ Logging comprehensive (now with INFO-level vote details)
- ‚úÖ SentenceTransformers neural embeddings active

## Questions for Next Session

1. Should we proceed with marketing (blog post, HN, Twitter)?
2. Should we fix the minor scores_by_round tracking?
3. Ready to merge feature branch to main?
