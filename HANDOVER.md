# Structured Voting Implementation - Session Handover

## âœ… Completed Work

### Core Implementation (10 commits, 40 tests passing)

**1. Voting Data Models** âœ…
- `Vote`: option, confidence (0.0-1.0), rationale, continue_debate flag
- `RoundVote`: Links votes to rounds/participants/timestamps  
- `VotingResult`: Aggregated tallies, consensus detection, winning options
- Files: `models/schema.py:71-94`, `tests/unit/test_models.py:155-266`

**2. Vote Parsing & Aggregation** âœ…
- `_parse_vote()`: Extracts votes from responses using `VOTE: {json}` marker
- `_aggregate_votes()`: Collects votes across all rounds, determines winner
- Consensus detection: unanimous (3-0), majority (2-1), or tie (1-1-1)
- Files: `deliberation/engine.py:167-257`

**3. Voting Prompts** âœ…
- `_build_voting_instructions()`: Clear format with examples
- `_enhance_prompt_with_voting()`: Adds instructions to all prompts
- Integrated into `execute_round()` - all models receive voting guidelines
- Files: `deliberation/engine.py:259-293`

**4. Enhanced Convergence** âœ…
- Added voting-based statuses: `unanimous_consensus`, `majority_decision`, `tie`, `unknown`
- Voting outcomes override semantic similarity for convergence status
- Files: `models/schema.py:121-136`, `deliberation/engine.py:495-530`

**5. Documentation** âœ…
- Updated CLAUDE.md with architecture details
- Updated README.md with user-facing features
- Added convergence configuration examples

### Test Coverage: 40/40 passing
- 20 model tests (9 voting-specific)
- 20 engine tests (9 voting-specific)
- Zero regressions, full TDD methodology

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Work

### 1. Update TranscriptManager (Priority: High)
**Goal**: Display voting tallies in markdown transcripts

**Tasks**:
- Add voting section to transcript template
- Display final vote tally by option
- Show per-round voting breakdown  
- Include confidence levels and rationale
- Format winning option prominently

**Files to modify**:
- `deliberation/transcript.py` (add voting section)
- `tests/unit/test_transcript.py` (add voting display tests)

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours

### 2. Integration Tests (Priority: Medium)
**Goal**: End-to-end voting workflow tests

**Tasks**:
- Test full deliberation with real voting
- Verify voting results in transcript files
- Test various voting scenarios (unanimous, majority, tie)
- Test early stopping based on votes

**Files to create**:
- `tests/integration/test_voting_workflow.py`

**Estimated effort**: 1-2 hours

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start for Next Session

```bash
# 1. Review current state
git log --oneline -10
pytest tests/unit -v  # Should see 40 passing

# 2. Start with transcript display
pytest tests/unit/test_transcript.py -v  # Review existing tests
code deliberation/transcript.py  # Add voting section

# 3. Follow TDD
# - Write test for voting display
# - Run test (RED phase)
# - Implement feature (GREEN phase)
# - Refactor if needed

# 4. Commit when done
git add -A && git commit -m "Add voting display to transcripts"
```

## ðŸ“Š Architecture Notes

**Voting Flow**:
1. `execute_round()` enhances prompts with voting instructions
2. Models respond with analysis + `VOTE: {json}` marker
3. `_parse_vote()` extracts vote from response
4. `_aggregate_votes()` tallies all votes after all rounds
5. `VotingResult` stored in `DeliberationResult.voting_result`
6. Convergence status reflects voting outcome

**Key Files**:
- Core logic: `deliberation/engine.py` (536 lines)
- Data models: `models/schema.py` (164 lines)
- Tests: `tests/unit/test_engine.py` (469 lines), `test_models.py` (266 lines)

## âœ¨ Impact

AI models now participate in structured voting with:
- Quantifiable consensus metrics (tally, confidence levels)
- Clear decision tracking (unanimous vs majority vs tie)
- Rationale for each vote (explainable AI)
- Adaptive stopping (models signal when satisfied)

**Next**: Make voting results visible in transcript files for complete audit trail.
