# Phase 1.5: Empirical Calibration - Session Handover

**Session Date**: October 22, 2025
**Status**: 30/50 deliberations complete - Ready for continuation

## What Was Accomplished

### Data Collection (60% Complete)
- ✅ **Batch 1 (Q1-10)**: Technology Stack decisions (TypeScript, GraphQL, Go/Rust, Docker, Python, Kubernetes, Redis, PostgreSQL)
  - 10 deliberations, strong convergence on most topics
  - Decision graph context injection verified working

- ✅ **Batch 2 (Q11-20)**: Architecture & Infrastructure decisions (CQRS, gRPC, Serverless, API Gateway, Message Queues, Database Replication)
  - 10 deliberations, good discussion of trade-offs
  - Measurement logs capturing tier distribution

- ✅ **Batch 3 (Q21-30)**: Process & Team decisions (Feature Flags, Security Scanning, Semantic Versioning, Post-mortems, On-Call, Contractors, Code Review, TDD, Pair Programming, Trunk-Based Development)
  - 10 deliberations, strong consensus on TDD/Code Review/On-Call rotation
  - Thoughtful disagreement on DevOps team structure and coverage requirements

### Key Observations
- **Decision Graph Working**: Context injection from past decisions is visible in each deliberation (2-4 decisions injected per debate)
- **Tier Distribution**: Strong/moderate/brief tiers are being assigned by tiered formatter
- **Measurement Logs**: MEASUREMENT logs appear to be capturing tier_distribution, tokens_used, and db_size metrics
- **Convergence Patterns**: High confidence (0.80-0.92) on fundamental practices (TDD, code review, incident response)

## What Remains (40% of Work)

### Batches 4-5 (20 deliberations)
- **Batch 4 (Q31-40)**: Team & Product decisions
  - Q31: Hire contractors vs full-time
  - Q32: Implement code review for all PRs
  - Q33: Rotate on-call responsibilities
  - Q34: Have dedicated DevOps team
  - Q35: Use SLA-based commitments with clients
  - Q36: Implement strict code coverage requirements
  - Q37-Q40: Additional product/team decisions

- **Batch 5 (Q41-50)**: Security, Operations, Data
  - Security scanning, encryption, backup/recovery, zero-trust architecture, MFA requirements
  - Data warehouse centralization, real-time analytics, ML recommendations, comprehensive logging

### Analysis & Reporting
1. **Parse MEASUREMENT logs** from all 50 deliberations
   - Extract tier_distribution (strong/moderate/brief counts)
   - Track tokens_used vs 1500 budget
   - Analyze db_size progression

2. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Calculate average tier distribution across domains
   - Identify peak token usage scenarios
   - Correlate tier presence with convergence patterns
   - Detect any strong/moderate/brief ratio anomalies

3. **Generate Phase 1.5 Report** (`docs/phase-1-5-analysis-report.md`)
   - Tier distribution statistics (mean, median, distribution)
   - Token budget analysis (utilization %, peak, trends)
   - Convergence correlation findings
   - Calibration recommendations for Phase 2

## Files to Review/Update in Next Session

- `CHANGELOG.md` - Updated with current progress (30/50 status)
- `phase-1-5-deliberations.md` - List of all 50 questions (already created)
- `mcp_server.log` - Contains MEASUREMENT entries for parsing
- `transcripts/` directory - All 30 completed deliberations

## Recommended Next Steps

**Session 2 Plan:**
1. Run Batches 4-5 (estimated 20-30 min with MCP tool calls)
2. Parse MEASUREMENT logs from all 50 deliberations (5-10 min)
3. Perform statistical analysis (10-15 min)
4. Generate final Phase 1.5 report (15-20 min)
5. Update CHANGELOG and commit findings
6. Consider Phase 2 implementation based on recommendations

## Token Budget Notes

The MCP deliberate tool is working efficiently for data collection. Each deliberation takes ~2-5 minutes of wall-clock time but consumes significant token budget due to multi-round analysis (2 rounds × 2 models = 4 full Claude responses per deliberation).

For Batches 4-5, recommend running in 2-3 sub-batches to manage token budget effectively.
