# Early Stopping and Model-Controlled Deliberation Test Coverage Analysis

## Executive Summary

The test coverage for early stopping and model-controlled deliberation behavior is **incomplete and has several significant gaps**. While basic scenarios (100% agree to stop, all want to continue) are covered, many critical edge cases and interactions between voting and convergence detection are not tested.

---

## What IS Tested

### Early Stopping Tests (test_early_stopping.py)

1. **All models want to stop (100% consensus)**
   - File: `test_early_stopping_when_all_models_want_to_stop`
   - Coverage: Stops at round 2 after min_rounds threshold (2) is met
   - 2 participants, explicit `continue_debate: true` in R1, `false` in R2

2. **Min rounds enforcement**
   - File: `test_early_stopping_respects_min_rounds`
   - Coverage: All models want to stop in R1, but config requires 3 min_rounds
   - Should still complete all 3 rounds despite model consensus to stop

3. **Threshold not met (1/3 want to stop)**
   - File: `test_early_stopping_threshold_not_met`
   - Coverage: 1/3 models want stop (Claude), 2/3 want continue (Codex, Gemini)
   - With 0.66 threshold, should complete all requested rounds

4. **Feature disabled**
   - File: `test_early_stopping_disabled`
   - Coverage: Early stopping disabled in config despite all models wanting to stop
   - Should complete all rounds when feature is OFF

### Voting Tests (test_engine.py)

- Vote parsing, aggregation, confidence tracking, rationale storage
- Vote option semantic similarity grouping with 0.85 threshold
- Regression test for Option A vs Option D not merging at 0.729 similarity

### Voting Workflow Tests (test_voting_workflow.py)

- Unanimous voting (all same option)
- Split voting (2-1 majority)
- Continue_debate flag tracking (R1: continue=true, R2: continue=false)
- Confidence level progression
- Transcript formatting with voting sections
- Backward compat (no votes cast)

---

## What IS NOT Tested (Critical Gaps)

### 1. Exact Threshold Boundary Cases

**Missing: 2/3 consensus hitting 0.66 threshold exactly**
```python
# NOT TESTED: 4 participants where exactly 2/3 vote to stop
# 0: want_to_stop = 2, total = 3 → stop_fraction = 0.6667 >= 0.66 ✓ SHOULD STOP
# Currently: Only tests 1/3 (below) and 3/3 (above)

# Not covered:
# - 4 models: 3 want stop, 1 continue → 0.75 (meets threshold, should stop)
# - 4 models: 2 want stop, 2 continue → 0.50 (below threshold, should continue)
# - 5 models: 3 want stop, 2 continue → 0.60 (below 0.66, should continue)
# - 5 models: 4 want stop, 1 continue → 0.80 (meets threshold, should stop)
```

**Why it matters**: Off-by-one errors in threshold calculation could cause models to stop prematurely or continue unnecessarily.

### 2. Progressive Early Stopping Across Rounds

**Missing: Models change mind across rounds**
```python
# NOT TESTED:
# R1: 1/3 want stop (below threshold, continue)
# R2: 2/3 want stop (meets threshold 0.66, SHOULD TRIGGER EARLY STOP)

# Currently: Tests show fixed voting behavior (all want to stop or all want to continue)
# Real world: Models might converge gradually or change positions
```

**Why it matters**: Early stopping logic only checks current round, not cumulative decision patterns. Edge case where models initially disagree but eventually reach consensus on stopping should be tested.

### 3. Interaction Between Convergence Detection and Early Stopping

**Missing: Conflicting signals between convergence and voting**
```python
# Scenario A: Convergence says STOP, but votes say CONTINUE
# - Semantic similarity >= 0.85 (converged)
# - continue_debate: true in votes (models want more rounds)
# - Expected: Convergence takes precedence? Early stop takes precedence?
# - Current: No test covers this conflict resolution

# Scenario B: Convergence says CONTINUE, but votes say STOP
# - Semantic similarity < 0.40 (diverging)
# - continue_debate: false in all votes (models satisfied)
# - Expected: Voting should take precedence (model-controlled)
# - Current: No test covers this

# Scenario C: Early stopping disabled, convergence enabled
# - Votes want to stop but early_stopping.enabled=false
# - Convergence detects impasse (stable disagreement)
# - Should convergence override the disabled early_stopping?
# - Current: Not tested
```

**Why it matters**: CLAUDE.md states:
> "Override convergence status based on voting outcome if available"

But there's no test validating when voting takes precedence over convergence or vice versa.

### 4. Partial Model Agreement on Stopping (Exact Fractions)

**Missing: Precise threshold testing with various group sizes**
```python
# 2 models (no 2/3 possible, only 50% or 100%):
#   - 1/2 want stop (50% < 0.66) → continue ✓ tested implicitly
#   - 2/2 want stop (100% >= 0.66) → stop ✓ tested

# 3 models (2/3 = 0.6667):
#   - 1/3 want stop (33% < 0.66) → continue ✓ tested
#   - 2/3 want stop (66.67% >= 0.66) → stop ✗ NOT TESTED
#   - 3/3 want stop (100%) → stop ✓ tested

# 4 models (no exact 2/3 possible):
#   - 1/4 want stop (25%) → continue ✗ NOT TESTED
#   - 2/4 want stop (50%) → continue ✗ NOT TESTED
#   - 3/4 want stop (75%) → stop ✗ NOT TESTED

# 5 models (3/5 = 0.60, 4/5 = 0.80):
#   - 3/5 want stop (60% < 0.66) → continue ✗ NOT TESTED
#   - 4/5 want stop (80% >= 0.66) → stop ✗ NOT TESTED
```

**Why it matters**: Different threshold crossing behaviors with different group sizes could reveal subtle bugs in the comparison logic (`>=` vs `>`).

### 5. Early Stopping with Different min_rounds Values

**Missing: Various min_rounds enforcement scenarios**
```python
# Current test: min_rounds=2, early stop tries at R1 (fails, not min'd yet)
# NOT tested:
#   - min_rounds=0 (should allow stop at R1)
#   - min_rounds=4 but early stop votes at R2, R3 (should wait until R4)
#   - respect_min_rounds=false (should allow early stop even before min_rounds)
#   - Config defaults.rounds=3 vs request.rounds=5 (which is used as min_rounds?)
```

**Why it matters**: The code uses `config.defaults.rounds` as min_rounds in the early stopping check, but this might not align with request.rounds. Mismatch could cause unexpected behavior.

### 6. Early Stopping with Single Participant

**Missing: Degenerate case with 1 model**
```python
# NOT TESTED: 1 participant with continue_debate flag
# - stop_fraction = 1/1 = 1.0 (100%, meets any threshold)
# - Should stop immediately? Or require min 2 participants?
# - vote parsing with no votes (error handling)
```

**Why it matters**: Edge case around min_participants validation.

### 7. Voting Without Continue_debate Field

**Missing: Backward compatibility when continue_debate is missing**
```python
# Current: Vote model has default continue_debate=True
# NOT TESTED: What if old-format vote JSON lacks continue_debate field?
#   - Parsing handles it (default True), but early stopping should treat as "want to continue"
#   - Confusion possible if model returns votes without continue_debate
```

**Why it matters**: Backward compatibility for models that don't support continue_debate flag.

### 8. Mixed Voting Patterns (Different Options + Different Stopping Preferences)

**Missing: Correlation between vote option and continue_debate**
```python
# Scenario: Models disagree on WHAT, but agree to STOP
# R1: Claude votes "Option A", continue=true
# R1: Codex votes "Option B", continue=false (wants to stop despite disagreement)
# R1: Gemini votes "Option C", continue=false
# Expected: 2/3 want to stop (0.67 >= 0.66) → SHOULD STOP
# Current: Not tested (tests don't correlate voting disagreement with stopping preferences)
```

**Why it matters**: Real-world scenarios where models reach impasse but give up trying to convince each other.

### 9. Convergence Status Overrides After Early Stop

**Missing: What convergence_info contains after early stop triggered by votes**
```python
# Current behavior in engine.py lines 691-726:
#   IF voting_result exists:
#      Override status with voting outcome (unanimous_consensus, majority_decision, tie)
#   ELIF final_convergence_info:
#      Use semantic similarity status
#   ELSE:
#      status = "unknown"
#
# NOT TESTED:
#   - Early stop at R2 triggered by votes, what does convergence_info.status show?
#   - Should it show "unanimous_consensus" even though R3 wasn't checked?
#   - If convergence detected impasse at R2, but votes say stop, which status wins?
```

**Why it matters**: Transcript and result consumers depend on convergence_info.status. Incorrect status could mislead users about WHY the deliberation stopped.

### 10. Early Stopping with Decision Graph Context Enabled

**Missing: Interaction with memory/context injection**
```python
# NOT TESTED: Early stopping + decision graph enabled
#   - Graph injects context at R1
#   - Models converge faster due to historical context
#   - Does early stop trigger correctly with injected context?
```

**Why it matters**: Context acceleration could change timing of when models reach stopping consensus.

## Specific Threshold Combinations NOT Tested

| Scenario | Participants | Want Stop | Fraction | Threshold | Should Stop? | Tested? |
|----------|--------------|-----------|----------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| All stop | 2 | 2/2 | 1.00 | 0.66 | YES | ✓ |
| Majority stops | 3 | 2/3 | 0.67 | 0.66 | YES | **✗** |
| Minority stops | 3 | 1/3 | 0.33 | 0.66 | NO | ✓ |
| Even split | 4 | 2/4 | 0.50 | 0.66 | NO | **✗** |
| 3-of-4 stop | 4 | 3/4 | 0.75 | 0.66 | YES | **✗** |
| Below threshold | 5 | 3/5 | 0.60 | 0.66 | NO | **✗** |
| Above threshold | 5 | 4/5 | 0.80 | 0.66 | YES | **✗** |
| Disabled feature | - | - | - | - | NO | ✓ |

**15 core voting scenarios, only 3 tested.**

## Interaction Issues: Convergence vs Early Stopping

The engine code (lines 554-610) checks early stopping BEFORE convergence:

```python
# Check for model-controlled early stopping FIRST (line 571)
if self._check_early_stopping(...):
    model_controlled_stop = True
    break  # EXIT LOOP

# Check convergence AFTER (line 579)
if self.convergence_detector and round_num >= 2:
    convergence_result = self.convergence_detector.check_convergence(...)
    if convergence_result.converged:
        converged = True
        break  # EXIT LOOP
```

**Not tested**: What if:
1. Round 2 responses show early stopping votes (2/3 want stop) AND convergence detected?
   - Both trigger early exit, but only one is "recorded" as reason
   - Convergence info vs model control precedence unclear in result

2. Round 3 has diverging responses (no convergence) but 2/3 vote to stop?
   - Early stop should trigger, but convergence detector never checked convergence
   - Result will have early_stopping reason but empty convergence_info

3. Convergence disabled, early stopping enabled vs vice versa?
   - Two independent paths to early exit, but tests don't verify both work correctly

| No exact threshold boundary tests | Medium | Off-by-one errors in stop/continue decision |
| No convergence-voting interaction tests | High | Unpredictable behavior when both signals present |
| No progressive convergence to stopping (R1→R2) | Medium | Doesn't test real-world gradual consensus |
| Only 3 of 15 voting threshold combinations tested | High | Incomplete coverage for all group sizes |
| Missing decision graph + early stop interaction | Low | May cause issues with context-accelerated decisions |
| No conflicting signal resolution (conv vs voting) | High | When both signals disagree, behavior undefined in tests |
| No backward compat for votes without continue_debate | Low | May break with legacy models |
| No mixed voting options + stopping preferences | Medium | Real-world scenario not covered |
