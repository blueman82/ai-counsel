"""Maintenance and monitoring infrastructure for decision graph.

This module provides monitoring, analysis, and archival preparation capabilities
for the decision graph. It implements Phase 1 (monitoring only) with preparation
for future Phase 2 (soft archival) once database size warrants it.

Phase 1 (Current): Monitoring and analysis
- Database statistics and growth tracking
- Health checks and data integrity validation
- Archival benefit estimation (simulation only)
- Migration SQL generation for future Phase 2

Phase 2 (Future, Month 6+): Soft archival
- Archive old, unused decisions (marked archived=TRUE, kept in DB)
- Requires migration to add 'archived' and 'last_accessed' columns
- Triggered when >5000 decisions AND unused >180 days
