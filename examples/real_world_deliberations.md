# Real-World AI Counsel Deliberation Examples

## Example 1: Event Sourcing for Audit Trail

**Question:** Should we use event sourcing for our audit trail?

**Participants:** Claude Sonnet + GPT-5 Codex

**Time to Convergence:** 3 rounds

**Outcome:** Unanimous - Yes, with caveats

### Summary

**Consensus:** Event sourcing should be adopted for audit trails with staged implementation focusing on high-risk operations first.

**Key Agreements:**
- Event sourcing provides immutable audit history (both models agreed)
- Query performance requires careful indexing strategy (both models agreed)
- Gradual rollout reduces operational risk (both models agreed)

**Key Disagreements Resolved:**
- Claude Sonnet initially favored immediate full implementation
- GPT-5 Codex recommended phased approach
- **Final Resolution:** Phase approach adopted starting with payment and auth systems

**Recommendation:**
1. Implement event store for auth/payment operations (Phase 1)
2. Add read model optimization layer with materialized views
3. Establish archival strategy for old events
4. Plan 6-month review before full system migration

## Example 2: Microservices vs Monolith

**Question:** For a new product, should we start with microservices architecture or monolithic?

**Participants:** Claude Opus + Llama 3.1 (8B local) + GPT-4o

**Time to Convergence:** 2 rounds

**Outcome:** Majority decision (2/3)

### Summary

**Consensus:** Monolithic MVP with microservices-ready abstractions; evolve to services after proving product-market fit.

**Voting Results:**
- Claude Opus: Monolith + abstractions (confidence: 0.95)
- Llama 3.1: Monolith + abstractions (confidence: 0.87)
- GPT-4o: Microservices hybrid (confidence: 0.82, but acknowledged majority reasoning)

**Cost Impact:**
- Microservices: $50K initial infrastructure + $40K/month ops
- Monolith path: $5K initial + $8K/month, migrate later if needed

**Team Capacity:**
- Current team: 5 engineers (better suited for monolith)
- Microservices would require DevOps specialist (unbudgeted)

## Example 3: React vs Vue for Dashboard Rebuild

**Question:** Should we rebuild our admin dashboard in React or Vue.js?

**Participants:** Claude Sonnet + Mistral Nemo (local)

**Time to Convergence:** 2 rounds

**Outcome:** Unanimous - React with component library (Shadcn/UI)

### Summary

**Consensus:** React chosen for ecosystem depth; Shadcn/UI for rapid development and customization.

**Factors Considered:**
- Existing codebase context (team already knows React)
- Component library ecosystem (React superior)
- Bundle size optimization (both acceptable with tree-shaking)
- Long-term maintainability (React has larger community)

**Implementation Plan:**
- Week 1-2: Setup Shadcn/UI + TypeScript
- Week 3-6: Component migration (auth, data tables, forms)
- Week 7-8: Performance tuning + deployment

## Example 4: Database Indexing Strategy

**Question:** What indexing strategy should we use for our user search feature under high load?

**Participants:** Claude Sonnet + GPT-5 Codex + Local Mistral 7B

**Time to Convergence:** 3 rounds

**Outcome:** Tiered recommendation with early stopping at round 2

### Summary

**Round 1:** Initial divergence
- Claude: Multi-column indexes on (name, status, created_at)
- GPT-5: Full-text search index + PostgreSQL GiST
- Mistral: Elasticsearch wrapper layer

**Round 2:** Convergence on hybrid approach
- All agreed: PostgreSQL full-text search as foundation
- Add materialized view for common filter combinations
- Optional: Elasticsearch for advanced search needs

**Performance Target:** <200ms for 10M user queries

**Recommendation:**
```
Phase 1: PostgreSQL GIN indexes + full-text search
- Estimated improvement: 40x speedup
- Zero infrastructure change

Phase 2 (if needed): Elasticsearch layer
- For advanced faceting and real-time analytics
- Keep PostgreSQL as source of truth
```

## Example 5: Python Testing Framework

**Question:** Should we migrate from unittest to pytest for our data pipeline tests?

**Participants:** Claude Sonnet (local) + GPT-4o (cloud)

**Time to Convergence:** 2 rounds

**Outcome:** Unanimous - Migrate to pytest

### Summary

**Consensus:** Yes, migrate to pytest with 2-week transition period

**Key Benefits Both Agreed:**
- Simpler assertion syntax (50% more readable)
- Fixture system superior for complex test setup
- Pytest plugins ecosystem (coverage, mocking, parallelization)
- Lower learning curve for new team members

**Migration Path:**
- Week 1: Setup pytest alongside unittest (parallel)
- Week 2: Migrate high-value test suites
- Week 3-4: Complete migration + cleanup

**Cost:** 10 engineering hours

## Example 6: API Rate Limiting Strategy

**Question:** What rate limiting strategy best balances DDoS protection with developer experience?

**Participants:** Claude Opus + GPT-5 Codex + Llama 3.1

**Time to Convergence:** 4 rounds (complexity)

**Outcome:** Consensus on token bucket + adaptive throttling

### Summary

**Round 1-2:** Divergence on strictness
- Claude Opus: Conservative (100 req/min per IP)
- GPT-5: Generous (1000 req/min per authenticated user)
- Llama: Middle ground (500 req/min tiered)

**Round 3:** Breakthrough on dual-layer approach
- All agreed: Different limits for authenticated vs anonymous
- Anonymous: 100/min (strict DDoS protection)
- Authenticated: 1000/min (developer-friendly)
- Enterprise tier: Custom limits via API key

**Round 4:** Final details on error handling
- Return 429 with Retry-After header
- Include rate-limit info in response headers
- Gradual backoff guidance in docs
