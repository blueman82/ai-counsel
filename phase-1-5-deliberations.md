## Execution Plan

**Batch 1 (Questions 1-10)**: Technology + first part of Architecture
**Batch 2 (Questions 11-20)**: Rest of Architecture + Process (first half)
**Batch 3 (Questions 21-30)**: Process (second half) + Team (first half)
**Batch 4 (Questions 31-40)**: Team (second half) + Product
**Batch 5 (Questions 41-50)**: Security, Operations, Data & Analytics

Each deliberation uses:
- Mode: "conference" (multi-round for richer data)
- Rounds: 2-3 (balance speed with depth)
- Participants: Claude Sonnet + Haiku (good skill mix)

Expected outputs:
- 50 decision nodes in database
- 50+ MEASUREMENT logs with tier distribution
- Diverse similarity scores for robust analysis
