# AI Counsel Project Progress Tracker
# Updated: 2025-10-22

project:
  name: AI Counsel
  description: MCP server for deliberative consensus between AI models
  status: Active Development

current_phase:
  name: Phase 1 + Phase 1.5
  status: Phase 1.5 Complete
  phase_1_status: Complete (Oct 22, 2025)
  phase_1_5_status: Complete (50/50 deliberations)

completed_work:
  - Phase 1: Budget-Aware Context Injection
    - Config schema (context_token_budget, tier_boundaries, query_window)
    - Tiered formatter (strong/moderate/brief formatting)
    - Adaptive k selection (db-size-aware)
    - Confidence ranking (no threshold filter)
    - Integration layer update
    - Backward compatibility
    - config.yaml updates
    - Observability hooks
    - Tests: 602 passing (41 new + 561 existing maintained)

  - Phase 1.5: Empirical Calibration (Complete)
    - Deliberation design (50 diverse questions across 5 domains)
    - Batch 1 (Q1-10): Technology Stack decisions - 10 completed
    - Batch 2 (Q11-20): Architecture & Infrastructure - 10 completed
    - Batch 3 (Q21-30): Process & Team decisions - 10 completed
    - Batch 4 (Q31-40): Team & Product decisions - 10 completed
    - Batch 5 (Q41-50): Security, Operations, Data - 10 completed
    - Decision graph context injection verified working
    - Measurement logging capturing tier distribution and token usage
    - Analysis: 35 MEASUREMENT logs parsed from 50 deliberations
    - Tier distribution: 13.9% strong, 6.3% moderate, 79.7% brief
    - Token budget: 11.1% average, max 68.7%, P95 43.2%
    - Consensus rate: 58% (29/50 deliberations)
    - Generated Phase 1.5 Analysis Report (docs/phase-1-5-analysis-report.md)

pending_work:
  - Phase 2: HTTP Service & Multi-User Support
    - Migrate from stdio to HTTP endpoints
    - Implement user-specific context injection
    - Add multi-user concurrent deliberations
    - Build user-facing analytics
    - Performance testing at scale

metrics:
  deliberations_completed: 50
  deliberations_target: 50
  completion_percentage: 100%
  consensus_rate: 58%
  average_context_injections: 2.26 per deliberation
  decision_graph_size: 62 KB
  tests_passing: 602
  code_coverage: Comprehensive
  branch: feature/budget-aware-context-injection

phase_1_5_highlights:
  - Consensus Domains: Security & Operations (unanimous), Simplicity > Feature Richness (majority)
  - Conditional Consensus: Architecture (context-dependent), Team Structure (thoughtful disagreement)
  - Database Efficiency: 1.54 KB per deliberation, 62 KB total for 50 deliberations
  - Token Efficiency: Opportunity to reduce budget from 1500 to 800-1000 tokens in Phase 2
  - Early Stopping: 15% of deliberations resolved with early stopping (cost optimization)

key_findings:
  - Decision graph context injection working correctly and effectively
  - Tier distribution properly captures decision relevance (strong for foundational, brief for specific)
  - Fast convergence on objective decisions (security, operations); deliberative debate on subjective decisions (org design)
  - Token budget is conservative; system never approached limits
  - Database scales efficiently; no storage/performance concerns
  - System ready for Phase 2: HTTP service and multi-user support
