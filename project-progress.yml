# Updated: 2025-10-22

project:
  name: AI Counsel
  description: MCP server for deliberative consensus between AI models
  status: Active Development

current_phase:
  name: Phase 1 + Phase 1.5
  status: In Progress
  phase_1_status: Complete (Oct 22, 2025)
  phase_1_5_status: 60% Complete (30/50 deliberations)

completed_work:
  - Phase 1: Budget-Aware Context Injection
    - Config schema (context_token_budget, tier_boundaries, query_window)
    - Tiered formatter (strong/moderate/brief formatting)
    - Adaptive k selection (db-size-aware)
    - Confidence ranking (no threshold filter)
    - Integration layer update
    - Backward compatibility
    - config.yaml updates
    - Observability hooks
    - Tests: 602 passing (41 new + 561 existing maintained)

  - Phase 1.5: Empirical Calibration (In Progress)
    - Deliberation design (50 diverse questions across 5 domains)
    - Batch 1 (Q1-10): Technology Stack decisions - 10 completed
    - Batch 2 (Q11-20): Architecture & Infrastructure - 10 completed
    - Batch 3 (Q21-30): Process & Team decisions - 10 completed
    - Decision graph context injection verified working
    - Measurement logging capturing tier distribution and token usage

pending_work:
  - Phase 1.5: Empirical Calibration (Batches 4-5)
    - Batch 4 (Q31-40): Team & Product decisions - 10 deliberations
    - Batch 5 (Q41-50): Security, Operations, Data - 10 deliberations

  - Phase 1.5: Analysis & Reporting
    - Parse MEASUREMENT logs from all 50 deliberations
    - Analyze tier distribution patterns
    - Analyze token budget utilization
    - Correlate tier distribution with convergence
    - Generate calibration report
    - Recommendations for Phase 2

metrics:
  deliberations_completed: 30
  deliberations_target: 50
  completion_percentage: 60
  tests_passing: 602
  code_coverage: Comprehensive
  branch: feature/budget-aware-context-injection

next_session_plan:
  - Run Batches 4-5 deliberations (20 remaining)
  - Parse and analyze all MEASUREMENT logs
  - Generate Phase 1.5 analysis report
  - Commit findings and update documentation
  - Plan Phase 2 based on calibration results

key_findings:
  - Decision graph context injection working correctly
  - Strong convergence on fundamental practices (TDD, code review, on-call rotation)
  - Thoughtful disagreement on infrastructure decisions (DevOps team, coverage requirements)
  - Measurement logs capturing expected data for analysis
