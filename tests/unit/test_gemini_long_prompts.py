**Option 1: Selective Cherry-Pick (24 commits)**
- Cherry-pick exact 24 metrics commits in phase order
- Preserves full commit history and progression
- ~45-60 minutes with conflict resolution
- Conflicts likely in legacy DI imports (resolve to TypedDI)

**Option 2: File-by-File Port**
- Copy 6 new files, manually merge 5 modified files
- No git conflicts, full control over what's ported
- ~30-45 minutes
- Loses commit history but cleaner implementation

**Option 3: Full Rebase**
- Rebase entire 46-commit branch onto current work
- Most complete, preserves everything
- ~2-3 hours, 143 file conflicts
- High risk of accidentally restoring deleted legacy DI

**Context:**
- Current branch: TypedDI migration complete (v2.360.321 deployed)
- Metrics branch: Contains Phase 1-5 work PLUS legacy DI we deleted
- User has exact commit list (24 core metrics + 21 infrastructure/docs)
- Goal: Get working flexible time periods without restoring legacy DI"""

Round 1 - claude@cli (for): I recommend Option 2 (File-by-File Port) because it provides the safest path forward with minimal risk. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Safety First**: The TypedDI migration is already deployed to production (v2.360.321). We cannot risk accidentally restoring legacy DI infrastructure through a complex rebase or cherry-pick operation.

2. **Time Efficiency**: 30-45 minutes is reasonable and manageable. While cherry-picking preserves history, the 45-60 minute estimate doesn't account for potential complications or additional conflicts beyond the legacy DI imports.

3. **Complete Control**: Manual file copying gives us explicit control over what gets ported. We can verify each change incrementally and test as we go, reducing the chance of introducing bugs or unwanted code.

Round 1 - codex@cli (neutral): Both Option 1 and Option 2 have merit depending on priorities. If commit history and git blame are important for future debugging and understanding the evolution of the metrics feature, Option 1 (Cherry-Pick) is worth the extra 15-30 minutes. However, if the primary goal is speed and safety, Option 2 is the clear winner."""
